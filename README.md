# Netflix-Website-SDE-NoQs
Welcome to the Netflix Clone repository!

# Description
This project for the "Markup Languages and Information Management Systems" subject is a clone of the popular streaming platform Netflix, developed exclusively using HTML and CSS. The main objective of this project is to recreate the user interface and visual appearance of Netflix, providing users with a similar experience to the original.

# Features
The Netflix clone developed in this project has the following features:

*Similar user interface:* The design and structure of the website resemble the current version of Netflix, allowing users to easily familiarize themselves with the navigation and user experience.

*Responsive:* The website has been created with responsiveness in mind, meaning it adapts to different screen sizes and devices, providing an optimal experience on both desktop computers and mobile devices. I have adapted the code for screens with a width of less than 600px, and I will likely adapt it for larger screens as well.

*Explanatory:* The code is commented with small explanatory notes, making it understandable for anyone new to the field of development.

# Usage
To use this Netflix clone, simply open the index.html file in your preferred web browser. The main page will display the Netflix homepage, where you can browse and access other pages such as the legal notices page or the login form for your personal account.

# Contributions
Contributions are welcome! If you want to improve the existing Netflix clone, such as adding more content or enhancing the design, feel free to submit your pull requests. You can also suggest new features or provide feedback to make this project even better.

# Legal Considerations
Both the images and logos used will be those of the official Netflix website for India (https://www.netflix.com/in/). I do not own their rights and I use them solely for educational and research purposes to improve as a programmer by undertaking new projects.

# Acknowledgements
We want to thank Netflix for being a source of inspiration for this project and the developer community for their support and contributions. This Netflix clone would not be possible without the collective effort of all those who have shared their knowledge and resources online.

We hope you enjoy exploring this Netflix clone developed with HTML and CSS, and that it serves as a fun way to practice your web development skills!
